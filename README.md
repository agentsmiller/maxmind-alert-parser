This will parse Maxmind minFraud Alert email notifications to an active Google Sheet using Google Apps Script
When you open a new Google Sheet, give it a name like "Maxmind minFraud Alert Report"
Give it the respective the Column headers: IP Address, MaxmindID, domain, billing location, data, txnID, Reason
This will parse the data from the Maxmind notifications to their respective columns
